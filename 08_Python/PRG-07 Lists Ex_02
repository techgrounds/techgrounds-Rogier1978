#Create a random numberlist and add values with the next and the last with the first.
#First created the list and printed it to the terminal.
# Next use a for loop to add value "i" wit value "i"+1.
#(len(numberlist)-1) counts from the end. -1 is tha last value in the list.

### CREATE RANDOM NUBERLIST
import random
numberlist = []
for i in range(0,5):
    n = random.randint(1,100)
    numberlist.append(n)
    
print()
print("Next is my random generated numberlist:")
print(numberlist)

#MADE UP MY OWN NUMBERLIST BEFORE USING A RANDOM LIST
#numberlist = [41, 43, 47, 53, 61]
print()

### MAKE LOOP TO ADD NUMBERS i = NUMBER IN LIST (0,1,2,3,4)
for i in range (len(numberlist)):

    ### SELECT FINAL NUMBER IN LIST AND ADD TO FIRST
    if i == (len(numberlist)-1):
        print(numberlist[i]+numberlist[0])
        print()
        break
    ### REGULAR COMMAND FOR ADDING NUMBERS
    print (numberlist[i]+numberlist[i+1])
