#Here need to add key-value data from a dictionary to a csv file. 
#I created a csv file in a text editor called "new_names.csv".
#Use import csv for the csv module, and "with open" command to access my file to read (r).
#"info" is the name of the temporary directory where the data is stored before adding to the .csv-file.
#I have used print cammonds to visualize the progress. 
#These are not neccessary but gives an overview of what is stored.

#open the csv-file and show its contents
import csv

with open('new_names.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row) 
print()

###add input to the temporary (info) dictionary. This data must eventually be added to the csv-file
###also a print of the data to update for check

info = {}
fname = input("First name?")
lname = input("Last name?")
job = input("Job?")
comp = input("Company?")

info.update({"firstname":fname,"lastname":lname,"job":job,"company":comp})

###add prints to check state of dictionary to be added

print()
print("DICTIONARY")
print(info)
print("DICTIONARY VALUES")
print(info.values())
print()

###adding the input data to the csv-file (newline is to avoid en empty line in the csv file)
with open('new_names.csv', 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csv_writer.writerow(info.values())
print()

###add extra print of csv file to check if it is added (for info purposes only)
with open('new_names.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
