# AZ-09 Shared responsibility model
Study the shared resposibility concept. 

## Key-terms  
If you own your complete networkinfrastructure (also called on premise), you are responsible for all the task required to make it run smoothly. Think about security, updating, scalabilty etc. If you use cloud services some of these responsibilities are transferred to bussinesses that are specialized in this type of activities. However, you have still the task to handle these services with care. You are for exaple still responsible with who you share access with, or what data you are storing. In other words the cloud shared responsibility model means that a provider of the services takes care for some of the security task while customers manages others, more bussiness related security tasks.  
These tasks may vary of the type of services you agreed upon with the cloud supplier.  You can have an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) subscription, were the customer has far more security responsibilities then if the customer takes a Saas (Software as a Service). The first  (Iaas) only supplies the customer with secured storage, virtualization, network, servers etc. The user here will be responsible for operating systems, data, apps etc.  
The other end of the spectrum is Saas (Software as a Service). Here the cloud provider takes responsibility for much more security tasks. The provider manages als software wich most of the time you can access via a webbrowser. Think here about a website were you van read your e-mail.  
In between of Iaas and Saas is Paas (Platform as a Service). This is used primarily for web developers and programmers. Here you have the backbone like infrastructure and OS were you can develop your own apps on.  

There are always 4 types of deployment were you are always responsible for. These are data, endpoints, accounts and access management. For the rest it is an agreement between the provider and the customer.
