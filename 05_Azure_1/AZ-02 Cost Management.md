1. I have created a cost alert by firtst creating a budget. Type in "budget" in the search bar en go to the budget service.  
2. On the budget page click on add. Here you can give the budget a name, give it some time periods and the budget itself. I created budget "AZ_02budget" with an amount of €40.00 for 1 year.  
3. When you click next you can configure the alert conditions. Here you can assign an email adres, and various characteristics of the alert. After saving you can see the name of the budget in a list and can review and inspect it. I configured it that after 80% expenditure of the €40.00 I will receive an email.
