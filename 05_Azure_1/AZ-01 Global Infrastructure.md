# AZ-01 Global Infrastructure
Bestudeer Global infrastructure

## Key-terms

**Data Centers**  
Physical buildings with thousends of physical servers with it's own power, cooling and networking infrastructure.  

**Azure Geographies**  
Area in the world with one or more Azure regions. If you want to make use of cloud services you want them physically as close as possible. These makes them faster and more reliable. Also compliance is a reason. Some data like financial or health cre dat are not allowed to leave a country.

**Azure Region**  
Each Azure region features datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter. They're connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. This design ensures that Azure services within any region offer the best possible performance and security. Azure has 58 regions worldwide.

**Azure Availability Zone**  
Azure availability zones are data centres connected by a high-performance network with a round-trip latency of less than 2ms. They help your data stay synchronized and accessible when things go wrong. Each zone is composed of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. Availability zones are designed so that if one zone is affected, regional services, capacity, and high availability are supported by the remaining two zones.  

**Cross-Region Resiliency**  
Store data and software over more regions. If one region fails another region can take over. The end-user will not notice any change.

**Azure Region Pair**  
Region pairing is the relationship between two Azure regions within the same geographic area to provide geographically redundant solutions. This is decided by Micrsoft.
