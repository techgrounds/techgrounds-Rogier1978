2. In the storage browser I have created two containers. One called "tijger" for the picture and one called "awswebsite" for the supplied website I uploaded a picture in the first and the files for the website in the second. Because the picture needs private access I have clicked on the link for the container were I could adjust the Public access level to Private. This will result that everybody can access the weblink but only I can see the picture.
