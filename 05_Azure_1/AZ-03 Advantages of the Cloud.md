# AZ-03 Advantages of the Cloud
Study cloud advantages.

## Key-terms  
**SLA (Service Level Agreements)** - The Service Level Agreements (SLA) describe Microsoft’s commitments for uptime and connectivity for Microsoft Online Services.  

- **High Availability** - Data structure keeps working even if certain components of the network failss (redundancy). They use e.g. availability zones to keep your data accessible. Region Pairs help with availability in case of regional or large geography disasters.  

- **Scalability** - Ability to handle increased load. This can be horizontal (more machines or connections), or vertically (more processing power per machine). Vertical scaling is easy, cause you don't have to make changes to the application, while horizontal scaling needs more adjustments. This is a manual process. 

- **Elasticity** - Ability to expand or decrease the cloud systems capacity  (CPU, memory, storage resources) according to changing demands. This can be done automatic or "dynamically".  

- **Agility** - Ability to react quickly to changes in demand.  

- **Geo-Distribution** - Cloud storage enables you to make data available anywhere you are. Instead of being tied to a location or specific device, people can access data from anywhere in the world from any device—as long as they have an internet connection. It's close to the user.  

- **Disaster recovery** - An end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solution that can be integrated with on-premises data protection solutions.


**consumption-based model**  
A consumption-based pricing model is a service provision and payment scheme in which the customer pays according to the resources used.

To automate or adjust the needs for your IT needs you can save money by turning of unnecassary resources. On the other hand, cloud computing also allows to easily expand those resources when needed, or even when needed temporaryily. This flexibility allows bussinesses to quickly adapt to a fast changing world.  
Also the need for valuable IT personel is less needed, because a lot of the IT work is outsourced to the cloud provider.
