Study Active Directory

## Key-terms
**Active Directory**  
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD enables your employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. Azure Active Directory also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet, and any cloud apps developed for your own organization.  

**Azure Active Directory (B2C)**  
Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution that enables you to sign up and sign in your customers into your apps and APIs. Your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications.  

In other words, Azure Active Directory is the place to configure users and their privileges in the Azure cloud. Azure AD B2C is used for commerce and interactions with consumers, citizen or members of other groups that do not require internal resources.  

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
Azure AD allows you to setup multifactor authentication. Instead of 1 authentication method you need more methods to access certain serices or data. You can divide the methods in three types of authentication: something you now (password, passphrase), something you own (keycard, phone) and something you are (fingerprint, retinal scan).

**Tennant**  
A Tenant refers to a single dedicated and trusted instance of Azure Active Directory and it gets created automatically when you sign up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription.  
The Azure AD tenant provides a single place to manage users, groups and their permissions for the applications published in the Azure AD. Azure Active Directory can be used to manage permissions for Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure as well.
